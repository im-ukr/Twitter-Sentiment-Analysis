# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
The project involves the following key steps:

Data Collection: Twitter data containing tweets labeled with sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) is collected using the Twitter API or a dataset available online.
Data Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to remove noise, such as special characters, URLs, and stopwords. The text is then tokenized and transformed into a format suitable for machine learning models.
Feature Extraction: Features are extracted from the preprocessed text data. This can be done using techniques like Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), or word embeddings.
Model Training: The preprocessed and feature-extracted data is used to train three different machine learning models: Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression. Each model learns to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.
Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using a separate test dataset to measure their performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to compare the models' performance.
Model Comparison: The performance of the Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression models is compared to determine which one performs the best for sentiment analysis on Twitter data.
Deployment: Once the best-performing model is identified, it can be deployed in a real-world application to analyze the sentiment of tweets in real-ti
